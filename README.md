## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://moqod.com/static/img/layoffs-01.min.png)

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global layoffs dataset. The primary objectives of this analysis are to clean the data, remove duplicates, standardize formats, and identify key trends and patterns related to layoffs across various companies, industries, countries, and the time periods. 

Questions I'd like to explore:

1. Date Range
2. Companies with Highest Layoffs
3. Industry Most Affected
4. Countries with Most Layoffs
5. Layoffs Per Year
6. Layoffs Per Month Over the Years
7. Rolling Total Over the Months
8. Top 5 Companies with Most Layoffs Every Year


Steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle NULL values, standardize data formats, trim whitespaces and fix inconsistent data.

2. Data Analysis: Write SQL queries to address each of the questions.
